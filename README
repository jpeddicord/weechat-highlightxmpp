When loaded, this plugin will send you a message over XMPP (Jabber) when a
highlighted message or a private message is received. Great for running under
a detatched terminal where you're not always looking at your IRC window.

Requires SleekXMPP (`pip install sleekxmpp`)

Changelog:
 * 0.6:
   - switch from sleekxmpp to commandline utility sendxmpp 
     (https://github.com/lhost/sendxmpp) or go-sendxmpp 
     (https://salsa.debian.org/mdosch/go-sendxmpp).

 * 0.5:
   - switch to sleekxmpp as xmpp library (http://github.com/fritzy/SleekXMPP)

 * 0.4:
   - Actually fixed random XML appearing in messages.

 * 0.3:
   - Fixed message type to 'chat'; should fix problems with offline send
     and XML embedded in the message on some receivers
   - Updated notes for using an XMPP resource
   - Removed "failed to send" notification, as it's normal flow


 You must configure this plugin before using:

   JID messages are sent from:
     /set plugins.var.python.highlightxmpp.jid someid@jabber.org
   alternatively, to use a specific resource:
     /set plugins.var.python.highlightxmpp.jid someid@jabber.org/resource

   Password for the above JID:
     /set plugins.var.python.highlightxmpp.password abcdef

   JID messages are sent *to* (if not set, defaults to the same jid as above):
     /set plugins.var.python.highlightxmpp.to myid@jabber.org
