When loaded, this plugin will send you a message over XMPP (Jabber) when a
highlighted message or a private message is received. Great for running under
a detatched terminal where you're not always looking at your IRC window.

Changelog:
 * 0.3:
   - Fixed message type to 'chat'; should fix problems with offline send
     and XML embedded in the message on some receivers
   - Updated notes for using an XMPP resource
   - Removed "failed to send" notification, as it's normal flow


 You must configure this plugin before using:

   JID messages are sent from:
     /set plugins.var.python.highlightxmpp.jid someid@jabber.org
   alternatively, to use a specific resource:
     /set plugins.var.python.highlightxmpp.jid someid@jabber.org/resource

   Password for the above JID:
     /set plugins.var.python.highlightxmpp.password abcdef

   JID messages are sent *to* (if not set, defaults to the same jid as above):
     /set plugins.var.python.highlightxmpp.to myid@jabber.org
